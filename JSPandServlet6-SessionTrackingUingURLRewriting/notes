URL Rwriteing is a process of appending or modifying any url structure while loading a page.
this concept is very important for web development 

when accessing any page from a server (html,servlet or jsp page) we can pass some key value pair data with url as well
www.onlyjavatech.com/abc.html?a=6&b=8
www.onlyjavatech.com/abc.jsp?a=6&b=8
www.onlyjavatech.com/abc?a=6&b=8                 //servlet url pattern

for example if want to access (servlet1) from server and in its url we want to pass name and roll number for servlet1
www.onlyjavatech.com/servlet1?name=Wahid&rollnumber=101
we can put some extra data with url , this is called url rewriting,
url rewritng is done in client(browser) and server (servlet) can access the values/data by help of keys and calling the getParameter() of reques object and pass the key

this can be used for state management as well, when the client sends the 2nd request the same key value pairs goes
with url to the server and serve can access and check wheather it is a new request or old request
Servlet can put some data with url in the response form.

we can pass string with space also not like cookies that suppor only one word
