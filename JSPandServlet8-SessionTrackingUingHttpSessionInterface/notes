Session Management usong HttpSession is the 4th techinique through which we can track/managae our session

Session Simply means small interval of time used to state management (an object will be made for a while and we can put values in it)
we can use the Session to make login system or put some user`s data on to server to remember

We can make mutiple application inside a server, and inside an application we can make multiple servlets

When the client send the 1st request server creates a session/object for the client (HttpSession object)
the object will have an id through which we can track the session/ remember the client, the object id is sent to 
client with response and when the same client sends the 2nd request server recognize it through the id

the object will remain alive until:
1-untill we have not closed the browser
2-invalidate the object your self
3-or when it time is not expired 

when the object is died, all the information is in the object will be gone, and if the user sends another reques
a new object will be created for that

Used mostly for login sytems, when user logs in, we can put their id, name, email or .... in the object and untill he hasnt 
loged out the session will be alive for him

HttpSession intface which is javax.servlet.http
it have some important method we can use

1- setAttribute(key, value)  / to store some data in its object, key is String type, value is object type we can put any thing, List,Image, array...
2- getAttribute(key) - to get value ,, returns object

3- getId()//get Session id , to check its old or new
4- removeAttribute(key)
5- invalidate() // expires / kills the session 

the object will maintain the data through out the session / our visit, it might be used by multiple servlet during our session

the good thing about HttpSession is that we can pass multiple values and the values could be used in multiple Servlets throuhg out 
our visit / session

whenever we visit any website tomcat can create a session for us, and we can put our data in that session.
