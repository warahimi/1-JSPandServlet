Session Tracking: is a way to maintain the state (Data) of a user in server / server remembers the user data
it is also known as state management

when a client sends a request to the server, HTTP protocol is uesed , Http is a stateless protocol.

Stateless: server threats each reques as a new request
Stateless: means when a user sends a request to the server server process it and send a dynamic response (sends the hompage/index.html)
but, if the same user send the second reques the server threats it a a new reques and new user/  server cannot remember it
is the previous user, and threats it as a new request. th is called stateless , and we gotta manage this statement 
fe. if a user logins in his first request, then he shouldnt be asked to login again if he sends the second reques to access pages
